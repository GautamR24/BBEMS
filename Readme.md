# BLOCKCHAIN BASED EVIDENCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO MAINTAIN CHAIN OF CUSTODY FOR DIGITAL EVIDENCE USING IPFS

With the prolific usage of electronic devices such as smartphones and computers, the amount of data
generated from these devices is vast. As such, there can be an expectation within almost any investigation for the need to identify digital evidence. If identified, collected and analysed in a forensically
sound manner, electronic evidence can prove crucial to the outcome of criminal, civil and corporate
investigations. Data recovered from devices like computers, laptops, tablets, mobile phone data etc.
are considered as evidence. However, this is only admissible if recovered using a forensic methodology
by a certified expert. So chain of custody an important methodology followed every forensic expert
to get the most out of the evidence. Chain of Custody refers to the logical sequence that records the
sequence of custody, control, transfer, analysis and disposition of physical or electronic evidence in
legal cases. Each step in the chain is essential as if broken, the evidence may be rendered inadmissible.
During the process, several people typically handle the evidence, logging it out and logging it in and
physically signing forms to complete the process. There are many opportunities to taint the evidence
and more importantly, to have defense attorneys claim the evidence has been tampered with. It is
therefore critical that the evidence can be reliably traced from collection to presentation in court.
By using blockchain technology with the chain of custody process, officials could greatly improve the
process of ensuring all five of these criteria are met. Blockchain has become a trusted technology that
is traceable through its blocks of data, which is vital when examining the historical chain of custody.
Any parties with the need to interact with the data that are in the chain of custody have had their
information immutably recorded in the blocks of data, thus rendering it untraceable The chain of
blocks also makes authenticity and verifiability evident. Basically, when the evidence changes hands, a
digital token is then moved along the chain, therefore identifying the real-world chain of transactions
on the blockchain. Finally, because blockchain is a decentralized leger system, it is, at present, literally
tamper-proof.
